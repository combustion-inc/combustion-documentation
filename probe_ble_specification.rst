Predictive Probe BLE Spec
*************************

:status: DRAFT

This document describes how the Predictive Probe sends and receives data over
BLE.

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Advertising
###########

When the probe is not inside a charger, it continuously transmits advertising
packets.  The probe supports up to 3 simultaneous BLE connections. If the probe
has less than 3 BLE connections, it will transmit Connectable advertising
packets, otherwise it will transmit Unconnectable advertising packets.

The probe's advertising interval is dependent on its mode of operation. While
in Instant Read mode, the probe has an advertising interval of TBD. Otherwise,
the probe has an advertising interval of 250ms.

The format of the Advertising packet and scan response are shown in the
following tables.

GATT Services and Characteristics
#################################

The probe's connection interval is dependent on its mode of operation.  During
normal operation the probe expects a connection interval between TBD and TBD.
While in Instant Read mode, the probe updates its status more often and expects
a connection interval between TBD and TBD.

The Predictive Probe implements the following GATT Services and
Characteristics.

Device Information Service
--------------------------

This standard BLE service provides static information about the Predictive
Probe. The UUID for the Device Information Service is ``0x180A``.

======================== ========== =================================== ==========
Characteristic           UUID       Description                         Properties

Firmware Revision String ``0x2A26`` Firmware revision                   Read
======================== ========== =================================== ==========

Probe Status Service
--------------------

Probe Status is a custom service that provides the current status of the
Predictive Probe. The UUID for the Probe Status service is
``00000100-CAAB-3792-3D44-97AE51C1407A``.

This service has a single characteristic that supports BLE notifications. Each
time a measurement is taken, the probe status is sent to each connected device
that has subscribed to these notifications.  The probe status includes the
sequence number for first and last record on the probe and the current
temperature from each sensor.

UART Service
------------

The UART service is a custom BLE service that emulates a UART. The UUID for the
UART service is ``6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E``.

The RX characteristic is used to receive data and the TX characteristic is used
to transmit data via BLE notifications. The format of the data sent and
received over this service is described in the `UART Messages`_ section.
