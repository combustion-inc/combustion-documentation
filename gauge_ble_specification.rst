:status: DRAFT

This document describes how Combustion Inc. Giant Grill Gauges send and receive 
data over BLE.

Gauge is Combustion's first product that is a Repeater Node, and also has additional
functionality. This means it conforms to the MeatNet Node BLE Specification in 
:doc:`/meatnet_node_ble_specification`.

This document details additional features and differences specific to the Gauge
beyond what's included in the MeatNet Node BLE Specification.

###########

The Gauge interleaves Gauge-specific advertisements between MeatNet Node advertisements.
MeatNet Node advertisements contain the repeated data for probes. Gauge advertisements
include information specific to this device.

UART Messages
#############

Relevant messages are included in the MeatNet Node BLE Specification, as they are
included in the repeater network's messaging protocol.


Product Type
------------
 
The product type is an enumerated value in an 8-bit (1-byte) field and gives
direction how to interpret the rest of the data in this message. Note that some
devices interleave messages with different 'Product Type' values.

Possible values:

* ``0``: Unknown
* ``1``: Predictive Probe
* ``2``: MeatNet Repeater Node (Kitchen Timer, Charger, etc.)
* ``3``: Giant Grill Gauge


Battery Percentage
------------------

The battery percentage is an 8-bit (1-byte) field that indicates the battery
percentage remaining in the device. The value is interpreted as a percentage
from 0 to 100.

Raw Temperature Data
---------------------

The raw temperature data is a packed 16-bit (2-byte) field that represents 
the raw temperature data from the Gauge temperature sensor. The value is 
encoded as a 13-bit packed unsigned integer with 0.1 degrees C resolution.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1-13   Thermistor raw reading
14-16  Padding/Reserved
====== ========================

The range for each thermistor is -20째C - 799째C. Temperature is represented in
steps of 0.1째C::

    Temperature = (raw value * 0.1) - 20

Note - If the Gauge sensor is not present as denotoed in `Gauge Status`_., the 
temperature value will be 0.

Gauge Status
------------

Gauge status is a packed 8-bit (1-byte) field that contains various status
flags for the Gauge.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1      `Sensor Present`_
2      `Sensor Overheating`_
3      `Low Battery`_
4-8    Reserved
====== ========================

Sensor Present
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 if the Gauge's temperature sensor is connected.
0 if not.

Sensor Overheating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 if the Gauge's temperature sensor is overheating.
0 if not.

Low Battery
~~~~~~~~~~~

1 if the Gauge's battery is low.  0 if not.


High-Low Alarm Status
---------------------

The high-low alarm status is a packed 32-bit (4-byte) field that contains
information about the high and low alarm configuration and status for the 
Gauge.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1-16   High `Alarm Status`_
17-32  Low `Alarm Status`_
====== ========================

Alarm Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alarm status is a packed 16-bit (2-byte) field that contains information
about the configuration and status for an individual alarm.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1      `Set`_
2      `Tripped`_
3      `Alarming`_
4-16   `Alarm Temperature`_
====== ========================

Set
~~~

1 if the alarm is set. 0 if not.

Tripped
~~~~~~~

1 if the alarm is currently tripped. 0 if not.

Alarming
~~~~~~~~

1 if the alarm is currently alarming. 0 if it is off or has been silenced.

Alarm Temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alarm temperature is a packed 13-bit field that represents the alarm
temperature in 0.1째C steps. It uses the same encoding as the 
`Raw Temperature Data`_.
