Gauge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Spec
*************************************

:status: DRAFT

This document describes how Combustion Inc. Giant Grill Gauges send and receive 
data over BLE.

Gauge is Combustion's first product that is a Repeater Node, and also has additional
functionality. This means it conforms to the MeatNet Node BLE Specification in 
:doc:`/meatnet_node_ble_specification`.

This document details additional features and differences specific to the Gauge
beyond what's included in the MeatNet Node BLE Specification.

Advertising
###########

The Gauge interleaves Gauge-specific advertisements between MeatNet Node advertisements.
MeatNet Node advertisements contain the repeated data for probes. Gauge advertisements
include information specific to this device.

Common Data Formats
###################

This document defines several data formats that are common between advertising
data and characteristic data.

Product Type
------------

Sphinx link:
:ref:`See Product Type <meatnet_product_type>`

GitHub link:
`See Product Type <./meatnet_node_ble_specification.rst#product-type>`_

Log Range
---------

The log range is a packed 64-bit (8-byte) field that contains the range of
log sequence numbers available on the Gauge.

====== ===========================
Bits   Description
====== ===========================
1-32   Minimum log sequence number
33-64  Maximum log sequence number
====== ===========================


Battery Percentage
------------------

The battery percentage is an 8-bit (1-byte) field that indicates the battery
percentage remaining in the device. The value is interpreted as a percentage
from 0 to 100.

Raw Temperature Data
---------------------

The raw temperature data is a packed 16-bit (2-byte) field that represents 
the raw temperature data from the Gauge temperature sensor. The value is 
encoded as a 13-bit packed unsigned integer with 0.1 degrees C resolution.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1-13   Thermistor raw reading
14-16  Padding/Reserved
====== ========================

The range for each thermistor is -20째C - 799째C. Temperature is represented in
steps of 0.1째C::

    Temperature = (raw value * 0.1) - 20

Note - If the Gauge sensor is not present as denotoed in `Gauge Status`_., the 
temperature value will be 0.

Gauge Status
------------

Gauge status is a packed 8-bit (1-byte) field that contains various status
flags for the Gauge.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1      `Sensor Present`_
2      `Sensor Overheating`_
3      `Low Battery`_
4-8    Reserved
====== ========================

Sensor Present
**************

1 if the Gauge's temperature sensor is connected.
0 if not.

Sensor Overheating
******************

1 if the Gauge's temperature sensor is overheating.
0 if not.

Low Battery
************

1 if the Gauge's battery is low.  0 if not.


High-Low Alarm Status
---------------------

The high-low alarm status is a packed 32-bit (4-byte) field that contains
information about the high and low alarm configuration and status for the 
Gauge.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1-16   High `Alarm Status`_
17-32  Low `Alarm Status`_
====== ========================


Alarm Status
************

The alarm status is a packed 16-bit (2-byte) field that contains information
about the configuration and status for an individual alarm.

====== ========================
Bits   Description
====== ========================
1      `Set`_
2      `Tripped`_
3      `Alarming`_
4-16   `Alarm Temperature`_
====== ========================

Set
***

1 if the alarm is set. 0 if not.

Tripped
*******

1 if the alarm is currently tripped. 0 if not.

Alarming
********

1 if the alarm is currently alarming. 0 if it is off or has been silenced.

Alarm Temperature
*****************

The alarm temperature is a packed 13-bit field that represents the alarm
temperature in 0.1째C steps. It uses the same encoding as the 
`Raw Temperature Data`_.
